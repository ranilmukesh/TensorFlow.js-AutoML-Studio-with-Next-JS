  target,
  baseConfig,
  autoMLConfig,
  (progress, trial, bestResult) => {
    console.log(`Trial ${trial}: ${progress}% complete`);
    console.log(`Best accuracy so far: ${bestResult.metrics.accuracy}`);
  }
);
```

### 4. Get Best Model
```javascript
const bestModel = results[0]; // Results are sorted by accuracy
console.log(`Best model: ${bestModel.modelType}`);
console.log(`Accuracy: ${bestModel.metrics.accuracy * 100}%`);
```
